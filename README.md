# EcoCycle

# Introduction
Due to rapid urbanization, economic growth and higher rates of urban consumption, India is among the world’s top 10 countries generating municipal solid waste (MSW). According to a report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), India generates over 62 million tons (MT) of waste in a year. India’s recycling industry is at its infancy, as only 5% of recycled material is currently reused. The wastes mostly end up in landfills increasing the carbon footprints in the environment. 
India also includes the informal sector (waste pickers) into the waste management process. However, the informal sector is not properly standardized. With our idea we are trying to create a producer-consumer relationship for the byproduct producers and the consumers, especially the small-scale industries that use these byproducts for creating other products and as well as for recycling purpose.

# Description

1. Our solution, EcoCycle, bridges the gap between corporations, individuals, and private facilities for the safe handling of solid waste and chemical byproducts. 
2. We facilitate transactions where one party can responsibly dispose of their waste by selling it to another party, ensuring compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016.
3. Our platform simplifies and streamlines this process, making it both safe and efficient. Private facilities, ranging from small to large-scale operations, utilize various methods such as recycling, reusing, after-treatment disposal, or other sustainable practices to manage these wastes effectively. 
4. We provide a secure and compliant environment for these transactions, promoting responsible waste management practices and contributing to environmental sustainability.


# Features
1. Just In Time (JIT) Inventory Management: an inventory for buyer/seller to have their own preferred company for transaction. Includes recommendations
2. Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback form to collect regular reviews from buyers and sellers, enhancing solution optimization for the industry.
3. Reviews: Allow only involved parties to give reviews on each other's performance.
4. Publishing: Sellers can publish posts explaining their byproducts and Buyers can negotiate with the sellers about the same.
5. Sellers/Buyers Profile: Sellers and buyers have profile associated with their account.
6. Profile Score: Assign a trust-based profile score to each buyer and seller of waste/byproduct, reflecting their reliability and likelihood of future transactions. For example, if seller A has a score of 80 and seller B has a score of 40, then seller A is safer as the score is higher due to reasons like less bad reviews compared to seller B.
7. Regulatory Compliance Tracker: Monitor compliance with environmental laws such as Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations, ensuring adherence to policies like handling management processes internally. For instance, EPR compliance where the company producing the waste needs to handle collection and transportation, etc.
8. Visual Predictive Charts: Display visual charts forecasting (ML Model) waste quantities and typical selling prices, aiding companies in making informed pre-orders.
9. Transaction Management: Provide transaction management tools, including an integrated chat feature and payment processing.
10. Blockchain Integration (need to discuss): Consider implementing blockchain technology for enhanced transparency in transactions, if feasible.

# Outcomes
1. Facilitates the collaboration among companies to develop recycling infrastructure.
2. CSR( Corporate Social Responsibility) : Strategy undertaken 	which takes an active and passive social role in the world.
3. Standardized in the informal sector (waste pickers) : This application facilitates waste management for informal sectors. For instance, waste pickets can sell the collected waste through the application instead of looking for potential buyers.
4. Increases RRR (Reduce , Reuse, Recycle) : This fulfills the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations.
5. Compliance monitoring : Continuously assessing whether an organization is adhering to regulatory requirements.
